# DashQuest
Mission Statement
"DashQuest makes mathematics fun, social, and engaging for pre-teen students, transforming foundational algebra practice into competitive, space-themed adventures!"
DashQuest is proudly open source. You can find the full codebase on GitHub, where we welcome responsible collaboration at https://github.com/AdyaS2010/Dash/tree/main
Introduction to DashQuest:
At its core, DashQuest isn’t just another educational tool—it’s part of a larger shift in how we approach learning. How can we make traditionally "boring" subjects like math, science, history, and language arts both fun and effective? The answer lies in gamification, and that's where DashQuest steps in.
In a world filled with distractions, students are more motivated when learning feels like an adventure. DashQuest gamifies Algebra 1 by turning math problems into space missions where players actively engage with the content. It's not just about answering questions—it's about navigating through asteroid fields, earning experience points (XP), and leveling up as they master math concepts. 
The interactivity behind this lies in the user being tasked with adventures like Quests to uphold stats like streaks and play games similar to popular mobile games in order to learn mathematics. By blending Algebra 1 content with features that are engaging for users, DashQuest is able to interact with users to give them a more positive learning experience.
But DashQuest isn't just limited to math. The platform’s approach can be scaled to other subjects like science, history, and language arts, offering students interactive quizzes, puzzles, and progress tracking in a fun, competitive environment. It’s designed to make learning a dynamic, engaging process, rather than a passive, solitary experience.

Enable "Install from unknown sources" on your Android device by navigating to Settings > Security > Unknown Sources.
Connect your Android device to your computer via USB.
Transfer the APK file to your device.
Open the APK file from your device's file manager to begin installation.
Note: We aim to officially beta test our app on TestFlight and upload it to more central platforms such as the App Store (for iOS) or Google Play (for Android). As a result, user installation of our app will likely become much easier! This is our recommended method until then.
Opening the App
You will be able to view our app icon in your app list on your phone’s homepage. Open the app, which will first display our app’s splash screen and then automatically take you to the login screen.
Login / Sign-Up Screen:
Create an Account: Sign up using your email and password. Your progress, high scores, and achievements will be saved securely in Firebase. (Note: To navigate to this screen, you must click the ‘Create Account’ link underneath the login button.)
Login: Enter your credentials to continue from where you left off.
Dashboard:
Personalized dashboard: This is where you’ll land once logged in. Here, you can see your XP, high score, day streak, and level progress.
Level Containers: Each level corresponds to a different math concept (tagged with a brief description of skills learned, difficulty, and possible amount of XP). Levels are displayed in containers, which are unlocked through XP progression from games. The user can scroll down to view all the levels.
Opening a Lesson: Clicking an unlocked level container will navigate you to the corresponding lesson page.
The Dashboard feature is a direct representation of user progress tracking, a key gamification element to subjects like Algebra 1 motivating users to keep practicing in order to keep their stats up.
Lesson Pages
Each Lesson Page: Each lesson page will contain its own lesson. These lessons are meant to build upon existing concepts from any skill level. As a result, each container displays information about a different subtopic, so you can scroll ahead and navigate through the lesson at your own pace.
Lesson Versatility: While DashQuest is an app meant to test Algebra knowledge, its question banks and lesson plans are filled in based on the subject we chose. This means that layouts and gamification elements from DashQuest could also extend to other subjects like history, science, and language arts–  using our refined gamification system to inspire users to learn so many more concepts!
If you need more practice before starting the game, we also provide mini quizzes (show the answers to the practice problem sets by clicking the “Show Answers” button from each container). Each lesson will include practice questions with buttons to show their answers. This correlates to the overarching prompt our app was based on by creating a quiz-like feature allowing users to assess their own knowledge of unfamiliar concepts.
Exiting the Lesson Screen: Press the back icon in the top left of the lesson screen to return to the dashboard.
Start Mission Button: At the bottom of the dashboard, you'll find the "Start Mission" button. Clicking this will take you to a space mission where you can answer algebra questions to earn XP and clear asteroid belts.
Space Mission Gameplay:
Control Rocket: Use the on-screen controls to move your rocket left or right.
Answering Questions: Each asteroid belt will contain math questions. The rocket must fly through the asteroid with the correct answer to earn XP and progress.
Coins: Randomly scattered throughout the level, coins provide bonus XP when collected.
Time Pressure: Make sure to answer quickly and accurately, as the timer runs while navigating the asteroids.
Navigation: You can pause and exit the game at any time using the menu on the top right-hand side.
The pause button will allow you to take a break from gameplay, featuring familiar buttons with icons to resume the game, restart the gameplay, or navigate back to the dashboard displaying user stats.
The X button in the top right menu will take the user back to the current lesson plan.
Note: If you end gameplay before the game is completed, XP and accuracy stats from that level will not be saved.
Finishing the Game: When the time runs out, your rocket will pass a finish line. A “Mission Complete!” pop-up displaying game stats (XP Earned, Questions Answered, Questions Correct, and Percentage Accuracy will all be displayed in containers). There will be buttons to play again or navigate back to the dashboard.
Unlocking Levels: If you reach the threshold amount of XP needed to unlock the next level, you will be notified and open the next unlocked level from its container on the dashboard.
The Space Mission feature brings the prompt to life, using problem-solving, real-time action, and progression to transform math into a rewarding challenge. It was based on the fact that our games engage users to act as astronauts, using classic puzzle problem solving skills to not only figure out the correct answer to each question, but use puzzle skills to assess and determine what needs to be done from their role as a rocket in order to earn XP and level up.
Leaderboard:
Opening the Leaderboard: From the dashboard, click on the Leaderboard icon to view your rank compared to other players. Rankings are based on XP and levels.
Compete with friends and other students to climb the leaderboard!
Social Media Sharing:
“Share My Stats” button: From the leaderboard, you also have the option to share your high score or XP on social media through this button.
Sharing text: A fun message displaying XP and leaderboard rank will be created. Our platform is directly connected to all social media sharing applications from your phone - Students can share success via DashQuest’s social integration with TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and more, creating motivation through visibility and peer encouragement. 
Show your progress and invite others to join the fun!
Logging Out:
Log Out: Log out buttons can be accessed from the right side of the top navigation bar menu on both the Dashboard and Leaderboard screens. Clicking these buttons will restore the user to the login screen.

Why DashQuest Matters
DashQuest wasn’t built to be just another math app. It was built to rewire how students feel about learning — We took proven principles from psychology, such as the science behind what motivates and sustains curiosity, like flow state, design, feedback, habit loops, and reward systems, and turned it into something playful and powerful.
Every decision, from color palettes to question pacing, was made with real learners in mind. And if DashQuest helps even one student feel excited instead of overwhelmed, then this wasn’t just a project. It was a mission well worth taking.
